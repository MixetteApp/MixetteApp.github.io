Last week we had the opportunity to interview Geron Hoy, an amazing up-and-coming Philadelphia based artist.  Geron entered the music scene in 2011 with his debut album, Soldier. Music from Solider, and Geron's second album, Lunatic, has been selected to be played in over 7000 Starbucks stores worldwide.  Learn more about Geron in our exclusive interview below. 

<h2>Where are you from?</h2>

I was born in Laredo, TX but spent most of my childhood in Connecticut. We moved around a lot when I was younger and always had a sneaking suspicion my family was in the witness protection program. Although I never found any fake mustaches laying around. 

<h2>What do you love most about Philadelphia?</h2>

I suppose it has to be the history. I love living across the way from the oldest residential street in the USA. (Elfreths Alley). The cobblestone streets and the architecture is so inspiring, plus I always get to be on the lookout for ghosts. 

<h2>How long have you been writing songs/playing guitar?</h2>

I got obsessive about guitar at around 16 or 17 and started writing songs almost immediately. 

<h2>Does anyone else in your family play?</h2>

Nope! strangely and unfortunately I’m the only one but my niece Ella has a beautiful voice and is starting to sing a lot more!  

<h2>What music are you inspired by?</h2>

Anything and everything. I just heard a song called “Waiting” by Alice Boman at the end of a show that I watch that was really inspiring and powerful. I love when that happens.. 

<h2>It's Music Monday after all, so what do you love about Mondays?</h2>

Hmmm not much. It’s closer to Friday than Sunday?

<h2>When you're not recording, what do you like to do for fun?</h2>

Pretty much just hang out with my fiancé. I’m pretty boring and I think a bit agoraphobic so that doesn’t leave a ton of options for entertainment! 

<h2>Do you have anything new coming out? What have you been up to?</h2>

I have an new project I’ve been working on that is soon to be announced that I am super excited about as well as a lot of writing for my third solo album.
